  <h2>SPECIAL DISHES</h2>
  <div id="main-content" class="container">
    <div class="jumbotron" ><h4>BRIYANI</h4>
      <div id="briyani"></div>   <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent.It can be compared to mixing a curry, later combining it with semi-cooked rice separately. This dish is especially popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among its diaspora. It is also prepared in other regions such as Iraqi Kurdistan.[4] It is made with Indian spices, rice, meat (chicken, beef, goat, pork, lamb, prawn, or fish), or eggs. The word 'biryani' is derived from a Persian word, birian, which means fried before cooking. It is one of the most popular dishes, which has acquired a niche for itself in South Asian cuisine.

    <div class="jumbotron" ><h4>PAROTTA</h4>
      <div id="parrota"></div><p>      
      A Parotta is a layered flatbread, originating from the Indian subcontinent, made from maida flour, popular in Southern India. It is a common street food in southern India, especially in Kerala primarily, and then in Tamilnadu,Karnataka Maharashtra and the countries of United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka etc. There are different types of parotta including coin porotta, Malabari porotta, berotta, etc.

Parottas are often available as street food and in restaurants across Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. At some places it is also served at weddings, religious festivals and feasts. It is prepared by kneading maida flour, egg (in some recipes), oil or ghee and water. The dough is beaten into thin layers and later forming a round spiralled into a ball using these thin layers. The ball is rolled flat and pan fried.Parottas are frequently eaten with vegetable kurma or chicken, fish, mutton or beef saalna (a spicy curry). Chilli parotta and kothu parotta are prepared using parottas.</p>

    <div class="jumbotron" ><h4>ATHO</h4>
      <div id="atho"></div><p>      
     Atho is probably the dish that defines Chennai's version of Burmese food. It's actually a variation of a Burmese salad - Khauk swe thoke. This wheat noodle salad is made with dried shrimp, cabbage, carrots, fish sauce and finished with lime and fried peanut oil. These salads are referred to as athok or thouk in Burma, which became Atho in Chennai. The version here doesn't feature the fish oil, and is made with grated carrots, cabbage, fried onions combined with garlic oil, chilli powder and lime juice. The orange noodles are mixed with these vegetables (almost always by hand) and the Atho gets its crunch from the addition of bejo, a crispy deep-fried snack crafted with rice flour and a sprinkling of peanuts. The Atho makes for a perfect any-time snack; it's flavourful and yet not too spicy. </p>
